        $amount_approvers = $this->getAmountBasedApprovers($purchase_order['total']);
        
        // Department-based approvers
        $dept_approvers = $this->getDepartmentApprovers($purchase_order['department_id']);
        
        // Category-based approvers

        if (!$this->evaluateCondition($purchase_data[$field], $operator, $value)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

```php
// Approval delegation management
class DelegationManager {
    public function getDelegatedApprover($original_approver_id, $context) {
        $delegation = $this->getActiveDelegation($original_approver_id, $context);
        
        if ($delegation && $this->validateDelegationConditions($delegation, $context)) {
            return $delegation['delegate_id'];
        }
